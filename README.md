# Benchmarking of similarity measure algorithms
This repository aims to benchmark different similarity measure algorithms on their performance, especially with large data sets.

It's part of a scientific paper on case-based reasoning, and it will determine which similarity measure algorithms we will use for the work and the CBR library written in Python.

## List of similarity measure algorithms
These are selected similarity measure algorithms that will be benchmarked in this repository.

- Euclidian Distance
- Squared Euclidian Distance
- Manhatten Distance
- Chebychev Distance
- Cosine Distance
- Pearson Distance
- Canberra Distance

## Results
Coming soon.
